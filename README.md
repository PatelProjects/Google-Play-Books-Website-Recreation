A recreation of a previous version of Google Play Books using jQuery, underscore.js and backbone.js.

*Please note: Although I have my variations, I completed this project with the guidance of the "Foundations of Front End Development" Udemy course. That course can be found at this link: https://www.udemy.com/foundations-of-front-end-development/
